## This notebook presents a comprehensive approach to classification task which involvolves several substeps:

## 1. Data analysis 
- Pandas Profiling.

## 2. Data preprocessing:
- handling of missing values, errors, outliers;
- data cleaning;
- data transformation techniques and classification models choosing;
- Pipeline preparing to chain all the data transformation steps to model building process.

## 3. Pipelines optimization:
- find the best data transformation technique with respect to each picked classifier;
- randomized search of each classifier's hyperparameters;
- Pipeline's model calibration; 
- save tuned Pipelines.

## 4. Ensembling methods of tuned models:
- ensemble size optimization;
- soft, hard voting ensembles;
- averaged ensemble;
- ensemble weights optimization (grid search & differential evolution).

## 5. Stacking:
- 2-layer stack;
- 3-layer stack.

## 6. Confidence intervals calculation

## 7. Interactive Results 
- represent model predictions using Jupyter Widgets.
